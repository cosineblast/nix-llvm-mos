# what is this

This is a nix flake that provides the [LLVM MOS SDK](https://github.com/llvm-mos/llvm-mos-sdk)
binaries. 

By executing `nix shell github:cosineblast/nix-llvm-mos`, you can then use binaries provided by the project.

Note that this simply downloads the binaries from the llvm-mos github release page, it does not compile them on its own.
